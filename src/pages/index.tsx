        <p style={{ fontSize: '1.3rem', lineHeight: '1.6', fontWeight: 500 }}>
          Knowledge is no longer scarce. AI has made information instantly abundant. But human connection, trust, permission, and real interaction — those are now the rarest and most valuable assets.
        </p>
        <p style={{ fontSize: '1.2rem', lineHeight: '1.6' }}>
          The Human Channel was created to explore this shift. As businesses, creators, and societies adapt to AI-powered abundance, we believe the next economy will be built around <strong>trusted human interaction</strong>.
        </p>
        <p style={{ fontSize: '1.2rem', lineHeight: '1.6' }}>
          This is not a tech blog. This is not hype. This is about how humans will work with AI — not against it — to create businesses, relationships, and systems rooted in trust and dignity.
        </p>
        <p style={{ fontSize: '1.2rem', lineHeight: '1.6' }}>
          We're still early. But the future is rushing at us. The Human Channel will document that future, one conversation at a time.
        </p>
        <p style={{ fontSize: '1.1rem', marginTop: '3rem', fontStyle: 'italic' }}>
          Welcome to the last channel humans will ever need.
