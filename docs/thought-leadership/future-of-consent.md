# The Future of Consent

## Consent Beyond Checkbox Compliance

Current models of digital consent are broken. They rely on:

- Opaque legal language
- Implied or passive data collection
- Retroactive enforcement after violations occur

In a world of increasingly autonomous AI systems, consent must evolve into an active, enforceable system layer that governs real-time AI behavior.

Consent in The Human Channel system is:

- Machine-readable
- Explicitly scoped
- Continuously verifiable
- Immediately revocable
- Tied directly to identity protocols

Consent becomes not a policy artifact but an operational rule enforced at machine speed.

## The Human Channel Commitment

The future of consent is not paperwork. It is protocol.

The Human Channel is building this future by embedding consent into every AI interaction, ensuring that permission governs not only access to data â€” but access to action.
