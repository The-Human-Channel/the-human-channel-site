# SPID Compliance Stack

## Purpose

The SPID Compliance Stack defines how identity, consent, and governance are combined into a verifiable enforcement framework that regulators and organizations can trust.

It allows AI systems to:

- Verify that identity, consent, and jurisdictional permissions are valid.
- Execute permission-bound operations in real-time.
- Generate transparent compliance logs for ongoing regulatory oversight.

## SPID Compliance Components

**SPID Record**  
Contains identity attributes, consent terms, and jurisdictional information.

**Consent Layer Logs**  
Timestamped permission records linked to each SPID identity.

**Jurisdictional Tagging**  
Cross-border AI operations respect applicable legal frameworks through embedded compliance metadata.

**Verification APIs**  
Allow regulators or auditors to inspect identity-consent-status for any AI interaction.

**Smart Packet Delivery**  
All AI communications embed compliance metadata directly inside communication payloads.

**Revocation Protocols**  
Enforce immediate termination of unauthorized or expired permissions.

- EU AI Act
- GDPR (Europe)
- CCPA (California)
- Global data privacy statutes
- Future international AI safety regulations

## Regulator Summary

The SPID Compliance Stack gives regulators enforceable visibility into AI operations â€” not as post-incident audits, but as live governance infrastructure built directly into every AI interaction.
