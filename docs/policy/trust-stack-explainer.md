# The Trust Stack: Technical Governance Overview

## Purpose of the Trust Stack

The Trust Stack is the system architecture through which The Human Channel enforces transparency, accountability, and enforceable governance inside AI systems.

Rather than rely on external audits after harm occurs, the Trust Stack embeds governance directly into every AI interaction.

## Trust Stack Layers

**Consent Layer**  
Permission governs whether AI systems may act. Consent must be explicit, revocable, and bound to specific scopes.

**Identity Layer**  
SPID Protocol and PulseID bind AI interactions to specific individuals or authorized entities.

**Transparency Layer**  
Every interaction is recorded in machine-readable logs that regulators, users, and organizations can inspect.

**Governance Layer**  
Rules are enforced at machine speed through encoded compliance logic, jurisdictional tagging, and permission boundaries.

**Oversight Layer**  
Human-in-the-loop requirements ensure that high-risk or sensitive actions remain under human authority.

**Clean Voice Layer**  
Authenticity protocols prevent synthetic voice impersonation or unauthorized voice capture.

## Why Embedded Governance Matters

- Reduces the need for reactive enforcement after harm has occurred.
- Aligns AI deployment with both existing and future regulatory frameworks.
- Provides individuals, organizations, and regulators with real-time visibility.
- Ensures AI operates inside enforceable, legally compliant boundaries at all times.

## Regulator Summary

The Trust Stack transforms AI governance from an external policing function into an internal system design standard, allowing scalable AI deployment without sacrificing human agency or public safety.
