# Consent Layer Specification

## Governing AI Interactions Through Explicit Permission

The Consent Layer is the foundation of The Human Channel's Consent-First AI architecture. It defines how permission is granted, logged, verified, and enforced across all AI-mediated interactions.

The Consent Layer operates as a real-time decision framework that determines whether any AI system is authorized to initiate, continue, or process a given interaction.

## The Role of the Consent Layer

- Serves as the binding contract between the individual and the AI system.
- Embeds permission directly into data structures (via Smart Packets).
- Supports granular control over what data can be used, when, for what purpose, and by whom.
- Provides regulators with transparent, auditable records of consent activity.

## Core Consent Layer Elements

**Consent Scope**  
Defines the specific domains, topics, or functions for which consent is granted. Scope boundaries prevent AI from expanding beyond its authorized role.

**Purpose Limitation**  
Specifies the exact purpose(s) for which data may be used. Examples include: information delivery, appointment scheduling, billing support, or identity verification.

**Duration Controls**  
Consent includes both start and expiration timestamps, ensuring permissions remain time-bound unless renewed.

**Delegation Rights**  
Identifies whether an individual permits AI systems to escalate requests, hand off to other agents, or initiate follow-up actions.

**Data Access Permissions**  
Specifies which data categories the AI may access, including personal information, voice recordings, transaction history, or behavioral data.

**Geographic Jurisdiction**  
Links consent to applicable legal frameworks (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, EU AI Act), ensuring jurisdictional compliance.

**Revocation Mechanism**  
Enables individuals to revoke consent at any time, automatically triggering enforcement actions that terminate unauthorized AI activity.

## Consent Lifecycle States

1. **Pending** — Awaiting user initiation and confirmation.
2. **Active** — Consent is valid and enforceable.
3. **Paused** — Temporarily suspended by the user.
4. **Revoked** — Consent withdrawn and terminated.
5. **Expired** — Automatically terminated upon reaching the time limit.

## Consent Verification Flow

- AI systems check the Consent Layer prior to every interaction.
- SPID identifiers serve as the verification reference point.
- Consent Logs are updated in real time to reflect status changes.
- Discrepancies or expired permissions automatically halt AI actions.

## Consent Log Components

- Consent Record ID
- User Identity Reference (SPID)
- Timestamped Grant and Revocation Events
- Consent Scope Details
- Authorized AI System IDs
- Regulatory Jurisdiction Codes
- Audit Trail References

## Machine-Readable Format

The Consent Layer operates using machine-readable schemas compatible with:

- JSON-LD for data portability
- Smart Packets for embedded delivery
- API-based verification queries for external systems

## Relationship to Other Protocol Layers

- **SPID Protocol** governs the identity layer linked to consent records.
- **Smart Packets** carry the consent metadata directly with each communication.
- **Trust Stack** ensures that consent is enforced, explainable, and auditable.

## The Human Channel Commitment

The Consent Layer Specification reflects The Human Channel’s core belief that permission is the non-negotiable starting point for all AI interactions.

Consent is not an afterthought, a checkbox, or a buried legal disclaimer. It is an active, enforceable protocol that governs AI behavior at every step, protecting both individual autonomy and organizational accountability.
