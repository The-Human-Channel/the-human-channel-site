# Values

**Human First**  
AI must serve the interests of people, never the reverse.

**Permission as Foundation**  
Consent is not optional. It is the foundation of ethical AI interaction.

**Transparency Always**  
We believe in open standards, explainability, and public accountability.

**Privacy by Design**  
Data sovereignty belongs to individuals. Period.

**Voice Matters**  
Natural, authentic voice will define the human-AI interface of the future.

**Long-Term Stewardship**  
We are building frameworks not for the next quarter, but for the next century.
