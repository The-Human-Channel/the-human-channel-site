AI introduces power without precedent.

As these capabilities scale, society faces a core question:  
**Who controls the interactions — humans or machines?**

The Human Channel asserts that:

- Humans must remain at the center of AI systems.
- Consent-first design prevents exploitation and manipulation.
- Trust is built when identity, transparency, and accountability are embedded into every AI interaction.
- Voice will serve as the most natural, scalable interface for global AI adoption — but only if anchored to permission-based protocols.

The Human Channel exists to guide this future.
