# Vision

The Human Channel envisions a digital world where:

- Every AI interaction is rooted in clear, explicit human consent.
- Individuals own and control their identity across digital ecosystems.
- AI serves as a tool for human amplification â€” not displacement.
- Transparent, trustworthy, and accountable systems replace black-box models.
- Authentic voice becomes the dominant interface of AI-powered communication.

We are building the protocols, standards, and public frameworks that will ensure AI remains firmly human-centric for generations to come.
